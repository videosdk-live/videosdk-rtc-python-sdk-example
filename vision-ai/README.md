At Video SDK, weâ€™re building tools to help companies create world-class collaborative products with capabilities of live audio/videos, compose cloud recordings/RTMP/HLS, and interaction APIs.

## Vision Over Video in Real-Time

This repository provides an example of integrating Vision AI with the Video SDK using Python. The example captures video frames and uses OpenAI's API to generate descriptions of the frames, which are then published to a Pub/Sub topic.

## Features

- Real-time video frame capture
- Integration with OpenAI API for image description
- Publish descriptions to a Pub/Sub topic
- Easy setup and integration

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- Valid [Video SDK Account](https://app.videosdk.live/signup)
- Install necessary libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-python-sdk-example.git
cd videosdk-rtc-python-sdk-example/vision-ai
```

### Step 2: Install necessary libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your Video SDK token, meeting ID, name, and OpenAI API key.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Modify the `.env` file with your details:

```env
VIDEOSDK_TOKEN="YOUR_VIDEOSDK_TOKEN"
MEETING_ID="YOUR_MEETING_ID"
NAME="YOUR_NAME"
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

### Step 4: Run the Example

Execute the script to start the example.

```bash
python vision_ai.py
```

## Key Concepts

- **Meeting**: Represents real-time audio and video communication.
- **Participant**: Someone attending the meeting's session. The local participant refers to yourself, and others are remote participants.
- **Stream**: Video or audio media content published by participants.
- **Pub/Sub**: A messaging pattern where messages are published to a topic and received by subscribers to that topic.

## Token Generation

Tokens are used to create and validate meetings using the API and initialize a meeting.

### Development Environment

Use a temporary token for development. To create a temporary token, go to the VideoSDK [dashboard](https://app.videosdk.live/api-keys).

### Production Environment

Set up an authentication server to authorize users for production. Refer to our example repositories for setting up an authentication server: [videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples](https://github.com/videosdk-live/videosdk-rtc-api-server-examples).
